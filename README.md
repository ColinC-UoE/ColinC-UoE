## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
G'd evenin', my name is Colin Crawford. I'm a student from the University of Edinburgh, studying Computer Science.\
Academically, my interest primarily lies in computer simulation, which is the field my Masters project is in, and I'm aiming to become a researcher.\
My current usage of GitHub is for working on the course Programming for Biomedical Informatics. And my most recent prior work has been contributing to an experimental programming language called [Fluid](https://github.com/explorable-viz/fluid) - a research intern role at the University of Cambridge.\
Lastly, I like practicing to sing - more than occassionally, but less than frequently.
